Motivation
Accurate stock price prediction is crucial for investors, portfolio managers, and financial analysts, as it can help in making informed decisions, reducing risks, and maximizing returns. Traditional models like LSTM often struggle with the complexities of financial data, making it important to explore more advanced machine learning techniques. This project investigates whether models like CNN and Random Forest can outperform traditional methods in forecasting the highly volatile stock prices of Netflix.

Objectives
Predict Netflix stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques.
Compare the performance of traditional models (e.g., LSTM) with deep learning models (e.g., CNN, LSTM) in terms of prediction accuracy.
Provide insights that can help financial practitioners in making better investment decisions.
Methodology
The project involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Historical stock price data for Netflix is gathered from reliable financial data sources.
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, normalized, and split into training and testing sets.
Model Development:
LSTM: A traditional time series forecasting model.
Random Forest Regression: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees.
CNN: A deep learning model that is typically used for image data but is applied here for time series forecasting.
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated based on performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to compare their accuracy.
Comparison and Analysis: The results are analyzed to determine which model performs best for predicting Netflix stock prices.
Key Findings
The findings of this study contribute to the growing body of knowledge on financial forecasting by:

Demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of CNN, Random Forest, and LSTM models in the context of stock price prediction.
Providing practical insights into the application of these models for financial practitioners, which can improve decision-making processes related to stock trading and investment strategies.
